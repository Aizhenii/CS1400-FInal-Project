This is a simple two player stategy game. 

You have a set of game pieces on your side. Each turn you can only move each piece 2 grids. 
You can end your turn any time by pressing the red button on the side. 
When triangles collide with each other, both of them will disappear. When a triangle hits a square, then the game piece will disappear. 

You lose if all your game pieces are gone.

Have fun :)
